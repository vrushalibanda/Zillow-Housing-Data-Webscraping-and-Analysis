#Problem Description


The real estate market is something that every person living in the country has to deal with, and as a result it makes a great topic about data analytics. The housing price or rental price in San Francisco Bay Area accelerating at shocking rates. From 2010 to 2017, the median price of a single family home in San Francisco has gone from approximately &775,000 to $1.5 million
This project was aimed at collecting real estate data from The zillow website by web scraping and doing visualization and analysis on this data.

#Python Libraries used:

#Web scraping:

Data was collected for various California counties by scraping the zillow website for sold houses and new listings. The type of data collected includes the basic data of the house (beds, baths, area, price, etc) and some advanced data as well like type of property, schools in the area, walking and biking convenience, etc.

This data was then cleaned to make it ready for analysis. Redundant data was removed. Missing data was treated properly.

#Analysis:

Seaborn and matplotlib were used to do visualization of the data. The visualization gave some very good information about the trends we see with respect to the type of property. For instance, we see that Townhouses are very famous in the bay area, especially San Francisco. This is because there is not enough land available there to build new houses.

There was other analysis done as well using property type and other fields.
